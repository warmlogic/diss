\section{Proposed dependent measures}

\cbstart
The terms subsequent memory and subsequent retrieval were mentioned earlier.  To be clear on these and related terms, subsequent memory effects (SMEs) show differences during encoding that are contingent upon later memory performance, and examining these differences sheds light on why some things can be remembered later while others are forgotten.
\cbend

Because the spacing effect predicts a long-term memory advantage for spaced compared to massed study repetitions, it seems likely that there will be differences between spaced and massed repetitions that interact with subsequent memory.  However, it also seems likely that when encoding is successful for both spaced and massed repetitions, the active memory mechanisms should be qualitatively similar.  There may be a quantitative difference (the difference is in the degree of processing), but it remains possible that memory will not be critical to determining why the spacing effect occurs; many factors besides encoding mechanisms can influence subsequent memory.  Although we will investigate neural patterns known to be associated with memory encoding and retrieval, other cognitive factors must be considered.  For example, attention and semantic processing likely influence the spacing effect.  Effects of spacing for repetition events without a subsequent memory interaction can also reveal processing differences between spaced and massed items.

% Attentional effects
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\subsection{Goal 1: Effects of attention and semantic processing}

% This goal assesses how attentional and semantic processes are modulated by spaced and massed presentation, and mainly speaks to the deficient processing account.

Assessing how attentional and semantic processes are modulated by spaced and massed presentation is central to the deficient processing theory.
% Though deficient processing implicates a deficiency for encoding (and subsequently remembering) massed items as opposed to an enhancement for spaced items \cite{DelaEtal2010}, it is worthwhile to investigate because recent research has given this hypothesis considerable attention \cite{BrauRubi1998,CallSchw2010,VanSEtal2007,WagnEtal2000,XueEtal2011}.
The present understanding is that an involuntary decrease in stimulus processing occurs for repetitions of recently encountered (massed) items, while this does not occur for spaced repetitions.
% Along these lines, functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies that involve stimulus repetitions have embraced the idea that neural repetition suppression may lead to the spacing effect \cite{CallSchw2010,WagnEtal2000,XueEtal2011}.

Under the deficient processing hypothesis, massed repetitions should involve decreases in attentional processes.  Because early ERP components have been related to attentional processing \cite{LuckEtal2000}, these may show spacing effects.  The visual N1 ERP component (early negative occipitoparietal peak) shows effects of selective attention \cite{KlimEtal2004} particularly during discrimination tasks \cite{VogeLuck2000}, and is related to increased visual analysis \cite{CurrEtal2002}.  It also shows effects of lexical and semantic processing \cite{ProvAdor2009}.
It does not typically show subsequent memory effects \cite<e.g.,>{CurrEtal2002,DuarEtal2006,DuarEtal2004}, and may act like an early attentional gating mechanism and attenuate for massed repetitions.

The analysis of neural oscillations has become an important tool for cognitive neuroscientists \cite<for reviews, see>{HansStau2014,NyhuCurr2010}.
Oscillatory desynchronization (decrease in power) in the lower alpha band (8--10~Hz; widespread) is related to increased attention \cite{Klim1999,KlimEtal2007,PfurLope1999}.  Because deficient processing occurs for massed items, we would expect lower alpha to show more power (less desynchronization) for massed than spaced.  It should be noted that the functional interpretation of lower alpha is generally less clear than for other bands \cite{KlimEtal2007}.

Another idea tied to deficient processing is priming, specifically semantic \cite{Chal1993} and perceptual priming \cite{MammEtal2002,RussEtal1998}.  A primed and still-active representation during a massed repetition will require less activation of semantic or perceptual features compared to spaced repetitions, and thus less processing will occur.
% is sometimes related to different effects depending on the paradigm, but in those involving repetition it
In repetition paradigms the N400 ERP component (negative central peak) is associated with semantic priming and processing \cite{OlicEtal2000,VanSEtal2007}.  A more negative N400 is associated with more semantic unexpectedness.  Voltage for immediate repetitions is attenuated compared to initial presentations, and voltages becomes more negative as lag increases \cite{KimEtal2001}; this shows that spaced repetitions elicit semantic activation processes whereas this does not occur for massed repetitions when the information is still in working memory \cite{VanSEtal2007}.  We would expect this pattern under deficient processing.

\cbstart
A frontal effect called the FN400 (similar to but different from the N400) is related to recognition memory, specifically in relation to whether this is familiar (i.e., old or new; the component attenuates for old items) \cite{Curr2000,Meck2006,RuggCurr2007}.  The FN400 is unlikely to be affected by attentional fluctuations during encoding \cite{Curr2004} and should simply differentiate old/new recognition.  Since participants are asked to make semantic associations in the present experiments, and because prior work has been done with the N400 in terms of stimulus repetition paradigms, we are going to interpret activity around 400~ms in terms of semantic processing.
\cbend

% If massed repetitions are perceived as having stronger memory strengths compared to spaced repetitions (due to being primed and/or in working memory), retrieval mechanisms do not need to engage \cite{Gree1989a,VanSEtal2007}.  The FN400 ERP effect (negative frontal peak  indexes familiarity and should attenuate more for massed repetitions than spaced because massed will feel more familiar.

% \hl{(Tim asked: Or could it just be an FN400 that gets more negative with decreasing oldness? I asked Al about this during my proposal and he thought N400 seemed like a fine thing to call it.)}

For oscillatory effects, upper alpha (11--12~Hz; posterior) desynchronization (decrease in power) is related to the reactivation of semantic information from long-term memory \cite{Klim1999,KlimEtal2005}.  Decreases in power in the lower beta band (13--21~Hz; central and temporal) are similarly associated with the semantic processing of to-be-remembered items \cite{FellEtal2013,HansEtal2012,HansEtal2011a}.  If these bands reflect retrieving information from memory, we would expect to see less power in both for massed compared to spaced because the information already exists in working memory.  However, if the power decreases reflect the processing of semantic information after retrieval, both massed and spaced should show desynchronization, and massed repetitions may actually show an earlier onset because the information can be accessed faster.

% Memory effects
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\subsection{Goal 2: Effects of memory retrieval and encoding}

If attention and semantic processing are affected by study repetition lag, it follows that memory processes may also show effects.  This goal
% assesses how activity related to memory processes is modulated by spaced and massed presentation.  It
can address all three theories, but provides a particularly important assessment of study-phase retrieval.


% \hl{(I mention the FN400 but never analyze it as a memory effect.)}

The parietal old/new effect (late positive peak, also sometimes called the late positive component or LPC) is a recognition memory ERP component that indexes conscious recollection.  Its amplitude correlates with the subjective amount of retrieved information \cite{VilbEtal2006,Wild2000,WildRugg1996}.
% It is similar in latency and topography to what is termed the late parietal component (LPC) by the only EEG investigation of the spacing effect \cite{VanSEtal2007}, but these authors state that it may be related to the P300 such that it reflects stimulus classification speed (``template matching'' to a representation stored in memory).
The LPC is also seen in repetition experiments \cite{OlicEtal2000,VanSEtal2007}, and is linked to successful conscious retrieval of an item's prior presentation.
Under deficient processing,
% both explanations should show the same pattern: whether the massed item has a stronger memory strength or is more quickly classified as having been seen before,
there should be a larger effect for massed than spaced repetitions relative to new items due to perceived memory strength.
On the other hand, study-phase retrieval requires episodic retrieval during a spaced repetition while deficient processing and contextual variability do not.  \cbstart  Because spaced repetitions need to be retrieved from long-term memory but massed do not, if the LPC indexes retrieval then study-phase retrieval theory might predict a larger effect for spaced repetitions than for massed.  However, we do not expect this to be the case because of prior stimulus repetition research that showed a larger effect for massed items.
\cbend

Theta power (4--7~Hz; frontal, temporal, and parietal) is related to memory formation and retrieval, particularly in medial temporal lobe regions (\citeNP{Klim1999,KlimEtal1996b,KlimEtal2006,LongEtal2014a,SedeEtal2003}; for a review, see \citeNP{MitcEtal2008a}).  It is also thought to reflect item--context binding \cite{HansEtal2009a,HansEtal2011a,StauHans2013,SummMang2005}.  Theta power should increase for spaced compared to massed repetitions, but for different reasons under each hypotheses.  Under deficient processing, theta is decreased for massed repetitions simply because the item is not being retrieved or re-encoded well.
Under both contextual variability and study-phase retrieval, theta would increase for spaced repetitions because the intervening context (and the prior presentation in the latter case) is also encoded (new information, item--context binding).
However, there is a difference between these theories: given that a repetition is properly re-encoded, in comparison to the initially encoded memory (Presentation 1), the ``contents'' of the two encoding events will be more similar under study-phase retrieval and more variable under contextual.  This brings us to the next goal.

\subsection{Goal 3: Memory reinstatement and contextual variability assessed via neural similarity}

We do not just want to know about attention, the extent of semantic processing, and memory strength; we also want to investigate the contents of memory and whether it evolves across study repetitions.
This goal assesses whether the similarity of neural activity for an initial presentation and repetition is correlated with subsequent memory performance, and whether this similarity is modulated by spacing.  These assessments will bear on both study-phase retrieval and contextual variability.  This can be tested both as a main effect of similarity (``Does greater similarity or greater variability in neural activations during encoding lead to better subsequent memory?'') and as an interaction with spacing (``Do spaced and massed repetitions benefit from greater similarity or greater variability during encoding?  Are there differences?'').

Although each theory predicts better subsequent memory performance (recognition, recall, etc.) for spaced compared to massed learning (except at very long retention intervals) and naturally includes encoding mechanisms as reasons for the effect, not all implicate processing at the time of test as having an impact on memory performance.  The similarity between an item's study repetitions and its subsequent memory test event is a meaningful comparison for contextual variability and study-phase retrieval.  For a spaced item, encoding variability would predict that the test is similar to only one of the study presentations, while it would likely be similar to both under study-phase retrieval.  Comparisons for massed items would be more difficult to interpret since context would not have drifted much.

% (e.g., an automatic \textit{vs} voluntary process, usually denoted by the effect occurring during incidental and intentional learning, respectively).

% Thus, the theories diverge in their predictions regarding the study and test conditions under which a spacing effect should occur.
% or the behavioral and physiological effects that should accompany spaced and massed learning.
% The theories can be supported or challenged by extending them to make predictions about the patterns of neural activity that should be seen during the study and test phases.  These predictions will be based on existing behavioral and neural data as well as formal models that account for the spacing effect, and will inform the proposed EEG analysis methods.

% \hl{If greater similarity between spaced repetitions compared to massed repetitions leads to better memory performance, SPR likely plays a role; if decreased similarity leads to better memory, CV likely plays a role.}

There are different ways to measure the similarity of neural activity between individual events.  For example, Representational Similarity Analysis \cite<RSA;>{KrieEtal2008} has been used in the fMRI literature recently \cite<e.g.,>{XueEtal2010} but has hardly been applied to EEG \cite<e.g.,>{GroeEtal2012,SuEtal2012} and has never been used in a memory experiment.  Other multivariate analyses have been used in electrocorticography (ECoG, or intracranial EEG) in relation to contextual drift \cite<e.g.,>{MannEtal2011}, and would likely be suitable if modified appropriately.  Regardless of the method used, a measure of neural similarity will help assess the nature of neural representations detectable at the scalp.  A challenge of this goal is that it is difficult to know whether similarity measures are comparing item features, contextual features, the currently engaged mechanisms, or some combination of these; this analysis would benefit from separating item and context features in neural representations.

% Classification
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

% \subsection{Goal 4: Memory reinstatement assessed via pattern classification}

% Recorded patterns of neural activity have been shown to reflect the information that is currently being encoded or simply thought about as measured by both fMRI \cite{KuhlEtal2012b} and EEG \cite{KetzEtal2013,MortEtal2012}.  Thus, it may be possible to detect the reinstatement of a prior study episode during a repetition (as in study-phase retrieval).  For example, in a paired associates paradigm where the paired items are presented successively (A, then B), if a pair A--B is retrieved during the repetition A' (just prior to B'), perhaps it is possible to see activity related to B during A'.  This method potentially speaks to all three theories, but this could not be revealed using univariate statistics.
% Multivariate statistical methods like pattern classification can be used to detect and analyze distributed patterns of neural activity that represent, for example, stimulus categories (category B during A').


% Whether this reinstatement occurs differently during spaced and massed repetitions is unknown.  If pattern classifier accuracy was high during massed but not spaced repetitions, this might support contextual variability, implying that context has not drifted far for a massed repetition but it has for a spaced repetition.  Study-phase retrieval would be supported if reinstatement was stronger during a spaced repetition compared to a massed repetition.
% Importantly, this pattern would need to be differentiated from that expected under deficient processing where activity during a massed repetition is also decreased relative to spaced.


% Because the brain is a dynamical system that incorporates a constantly changing array of cognitive processes and distributed representations, running multiple neural activity classifiers on the same data could measure the engagement of these processes.  For example, there could be one classifier for attention, one for semantic processing, one for encoding, and one for retrieval; each would make assumptions about when effects occur in time and where they occur in space \cite{BorsEtal2013,KingDeha2014}.

% This goal has not yet been analyzed.

\subsection{Summary}

% \hl{Brief exposure to experiment design. Recap processes involved in each theory and how they will be assessed.}

The overarching goal of this proposal is to assess the major hypotheses for why the spacing effect occurs by examining data from experiments that capture this effect.
% as supported by behavioral effects and patterns of neural activity predicted under spaced and massed learning.
We recognize that we are relying on reverse inference to test these psychological theories of the spacing effect \cite{Pold2006,PoldWagn2004}: patterns of neural activity are used to make assumptions about active cognitive processes, as related to prior research.  Since there is so little research on the EEG correlates of the spacing effect, reverse inference provides an initial direction for our analyses.
To briefly recap the factors that likely influence each theory, deficient processing emphasizes attention and semantic processing, contextual variability emphasizes contextual drift and study--test matching, and study-phase retrieval emphasizes episodic retrieval of the prior presentation during a repetition.
We expect that both theory- and data-driven analyses of ERPs, oscillatory power, single trials, and study--study and study--test neural similarity will support or challenge the theories, and will provide insight into the cognitive underpinnings of the spacing effect.

Experiment~1 involved a paired associates memorization task in which participants studied word--image pairs at two points in time in either a spaced or a massed fashion.  After a brief distractor task, a cued recall test was given where participants were required to remember the word originally paired with each image.
ERP and oscillatory effects were used to assess how attention, semantic processing, and memory retrieval and encoding mechanisms operate under spaced and massed learning and as modulated by subsequent memory.  Neural similarity was performed via dimensionality reduction techniques to attempt to understand memory content and contextual reinstatement.
Experiment~2 was an extension run using additional study repetition lags and used a similar design as well as similar analyses.

%Finally, the associative memory design will allow for the assessment of memory reinstatement during repetitions; this analysis has not yet been run.

% Two possibilities are proposed for Experiment~2.  Both predict the replication of effects from the first experiment where possible, as would be expected if we are analyzing the true correlates of spacing effect mechanisms.  The first replicates and extends Experiment~1 using additional inter-study lags.  Its purpose is to show that the behavioral and neural effects vary with the spacing effect as would be expected under each theory.  The second option takes an established spacing effect paradigm from the literature \cite[Experiment~1]{CepeEtal2009} and adds EEG recordings.  It is a multi-session experiment and has the added benefit of being more applicable to real world learning and simplifying the possibilities for why the spacing effect occurs (deficient processing should essentially be eliminated).  Options are proposed for adding a ``massed'' condition as either a between- or within-subjects manipulation.
