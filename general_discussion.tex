\section{General Discussion}

The results of the two experiments presented here (were mostly the same) (diverged slightly).  Why?




\subsection{Future Directions}

An interesting spacing effect experiment would be to take an established spacing effect paradigm from the literature \cite<e.g.,>[Experiment~1]{CepeEtal2009} and add EEG recordings.  This would involve a multi-session experiment and have the added benefit of being more applicable to real world learning and simplifying the possibilities for why the spacing effect occurs (deficient processing should essentially be eliminated).  A ``massed'' condition could be added as either a between- or within-subjects manipulation \hl{in this way (look at proposal)}.
