\section{General Discussion}

The results of the two experiments presented here (were mostly the same) (diverged slightly).  Why?


Theta effects support SPR and CV, but not DP.  Voltage similarity supports SPR.  TF similarity could support CV.

\cite{JafaEtal2013} MVPA theta.

Theta-coupled replay in coordination with the beta and gamma bands \cite{FuenEtal2010}.

Theta synchrony along the visual ventral stream (occipitotemporal region) is important for maintaining cortical representations \cite{DuzeEtal2010}


The present set of experiments failed to fully disambiguate the roles of XYZ in the spacing effect.


It would be enlightening to examine the effects that are related to the spacing effect.  Theta power seems to play a large role here.


\subsection{Future Directions}


Also: similarity of test vs study (P1 and P2) - CV and SPR
``encoding variability''  (p. 17) > ``contextual variability''
CV: spaced test is similar to only one study item, SPR: similar to both.
This analysis would benefit from separating item and context features in neural patterns, but this is probably not possible (future direction).


It would still be enlightening to get away from a paradigm that involves immediate repetition so that deficient processing could be eliminated as a possible theory. 

% \hl{More interesting would be a paradigm with external validity, something that has more of a real-world learning timescale (see Experiment~2b), but this may be too far removed from the current paradigm to make accurate predictions.}

An interesting spacing effect experiment would be to take an established spacing effect paradigm from the literature \cite<e.g.,>[Experiment~1]{CepeEtal2009} and add EEG recordings.  This would involve a multi-session experiment and have the added benefit of being more applicable to real-world learning and simplifying the possibilities for why the spacing effect occurs (deficient processing should essentially be eliminated).  A ``massed'' condition could be added as either a between- or within-subjects manipulation \hl{in this way (look at proposal)}.
